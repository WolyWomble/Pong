# Pong

Pongish clone made in Love2d

This is Single Player Variant of Pong intended to played with one dual analog stick controller. 

This game will currently just use the first controller that's connected. If there's not a controller, then game will give an error message.

As this is a single player experience, score increments each time a paddle comes in contact with the ball. The ball will speed up as the game moves on. 

High score currently reverts back to 0 when the game is reset.



Currently love needs to be installed for the game to be played.

Paddles are controlled with the right and left analog stick.
